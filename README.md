# EECS393 Bookinghub Web Application

Bookinghub is a database-driven web application that provides users with an easy way to make reservations for hotels and restaurants. Our database holds all useful information of hotels and restaurants. By going to the website, users can easily access all the information our database has collected. Based on the information provided, users can then choose the place and date they want to reserve, and finally confirm their reservation. This prevents people who are looking for hotels and restaurants’ from being overwhelmed by too much information on the internet and makes their lives a lot easier.
